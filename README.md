# AI Travel Assistance System

The AI Travel Assistance System is a smart travel recommendation application that suggests destinations based on the user's budget and preferred travel category such as Adventure, Relaxation, Historical, or Honeymoon. This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence techniques can be applied to real-world travel planning.

## Features

âœ… Smart travel recommendations  
âœ… Budget-based location filtering  
âœ… Category-specific suggestions  
âœ… User-friendly design  
âœ… Extendable for real-world applications (Flight info, Hotels, Maps APIs, etc.)

---

## Project Objectives

- To reduce the complexity of travel planning
- To implement AI-based filtering for personalized travel suggestions
- To provide an automated solution that is easy for users

---

## Problem Statement

Travelers struggle to find the best destinations that fit their budget and personal preferences. The aim of this project is to automate the recommendation process using an intelligent system.

---

## Algorithm Used

**Rule-Based Recommendation System**

This approach uses logical rules to generate suggestions depending on:
- User's input budget
- Preferred travel category

---

## Theoretical Background

Travel recommendation systems help users discover suitable destinations using concepts of:
- Knowledge-based AI
- Decision-making systems

Future versions may integrate Data Mining & Machine Learning to improve suggestions.

---

## Implementation

- Language: **Python**
- Libraries: Basic Input/Output, Conditional Logic
- IDE: VS Code / PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook

---

## Output

The system displays:
- Recommended travel places
- Category-based travel experiences
- Budget-matching options

(Screenshots will be added after execution)

---

## Future Enhancements

ðŸ”¹ Integrate Machine Learning for personalized suggestions  
ðŸ”¹ Include live hotel & flight booking APIs (e.g., Skyscanner, Booking.com)  
ðŸ”¹ Google Maps API for location and route planning  
ðŸ”¹ GUI / Web App / Mobile App version
